# Dell Poweredge firmware update script gen from ISOs 
This script will rip the .BINs out of a Dell firmware update ISO and generate a bash script for easier updates.

This allows you to update the server's firmware without needing to boot from the ISO.  

The ISOs can be found @ https://www.dell.com/support/article/us/en/19/sln296511/updating-dell-poweredge-servers-via-bootable-media-iso?lang=en but also works with custom ISOs created by Dell Repository Manager https://www.dell.com/support/home/us/en/4/drivers/driversdetails?driverId=9RX9M
